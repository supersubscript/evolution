Radhryy.midpt.README
 
 Radhryy.midpt files:

These files differ from the previous Radhryy files in that the
decimal day time stamp in column 1 now represents the midpoint
time of the hourly average, not the beginning or the end.

Each file contains data for one year indicated by yy

   These files contain hourly-averaged radiation data, from the SUNYA boom
at 27 m on the 30-m EMS tower.

"ddy" is decimal day of the year, in GMT. The "ddy" stamp represents
      the midpoint time of the hourly-averaged period, so the data
      period averaged would be 30 minutes before to 30 minutes after
      the given time stamp.	
day-integer day of the year
hour-integer hour over which most of the average occurred, in GMT.
     Note that this does not exactly represent the midpoint time
     for the given averaging period, as the midpoint could be anytime
     within the hour. The midpoint time of the hourly average is
     given in column 1 (the "ddy" column).		
Rnet-Net radiometer 
Sup-Reflected global solar radiation
Sdn-Incoming global solar radiation
Lup-Upwelling longwave radiation
Ldn-Downwelling longwave radiation
Rnsum-Sum of Sup,Sdn,Lup,Ldn with appropriate signs applied

Rnet,Sup,Sdn,Lup,Rnsum all follow the sign convention: positive up.
However, Ldn is positive in these files, in violation of the convention.
And PARdn is positive.

Rn, Sup,Sdn, Lup,Ldn,soilheat, and Rnsum  all are in W/m2. 
PAR is in millimoles/m2/s. 

The net radiometer is a Swissteco; it was operated from August, 1991
through August 1992. The global solar data come from Kipp and Zonen
pyranometers. Longwave data are from Eppley pyrgeometers. PAR is
from Licor quantum PAR sensors. Soil heat flux is measured with a soil
heat flux plate at 5cm depth.

There are times when Lup or Ldn were not functioning properly-these have
been set to NA in this data set.

Offsets in PAR for 1996 were taken out, but this still
left some noise. Negative values for PAR set to NA

From 1991 until mid-2001, data used were collected straight from campbell
dataloggers, which reported data every 20 minutes. The midpoint
time for averages during this period was consistently 10 minutes
after the top of the hour. For example, the hour 16 data would have
its midpoint at 16:10, therefore representing data from 15:40 to 
16:40.

From late 2001 onward, data that were used were merged into a serial 
stream and collected on a linux machine where averaging was done into
30-minute moment "mom" files, which were then made into hourly averages
for these files.  The time stamps for the 30-minute averages in the
"mom" were not consistently at the same time during each hour, so the
midpoint times for the averages reported during this period will
vary within the given hour.
